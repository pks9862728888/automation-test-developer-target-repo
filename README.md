# Getting Started
Demo project containing boilerplate code to run cucumber integration tests having Spring Boot as base layer.

> To run integration tests execute in terminal: `mvn clean verify -PrunIntegrationTests`

> To build helper controller jar:
> 
> mvn install -PbuildTestGeneratorHelperControllerJar

> To run specific test:
> 
> Create a file with name TempTestRunnerIT in parallel.runners folder
> 
> mvn verify -PrunSpecificTest

Output will be generated in the `results` folder.
